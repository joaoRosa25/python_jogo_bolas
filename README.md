Objective → Move the white ball and “eat the rest of the balls.” Each ball has a collision count (e.g., 20 collisions) and then disappears.
  There are two types of balls: Ghost balls (they help increase the size of the white ball) and normal balls (they decrease the size of the white ball). 
  If the white ball’s radius reaches 0 you lost the game.

Controls -> directional keys (Up, Down, Left and Right) 
            B-V to change velocity
